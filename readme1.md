# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

=======
**Week 3: React.js Fundamentals Assignment**

**Objective:**

- Apply React.js concepts learned throughout the week.
- Practice creating components, managing state, handling events, and using Tailwind CSS.

**Instructions:**

1. **Setup React.js Project:**

   - Install Node.js using NVM and create a React project.
   - Create a new project folder called `react-assignment`.
   - Initialize a React app and configure Tailwind CSS.
   - Ensure the project is properly structured with organized components.

2. **Project Structure:**

   - Organize your project files with a clear folder structure, ensuring separation of concerns.

3. **Create Functional Components:**

   - Build a `Header` component that displays a title.
   - Create a `Profile` component that accepts user details (name, email) as props and displays them.
   - Implement a `Counter` component that tracks and displays count using state.

4. **Manage State with Hooks:**

   - Use React's `useState` hook to manage and update component state.
   - Add event handlers to interact with the state (e.g., increment counter, update profile info).

5. **Integrate Components in `App.js`:**

   - Import and render all the created components within `App.js`.
   - Pass necessary props and ensure proper communication between components.

6. **Styling with Tailwind CSS:**

   - Apply Tailwind utility classes to style the components.
   - Ensure the UI is visually appealing and responsive.

7. **Testing:**

   - Run the project to verify all components are working as expected.
   - Ensure there are no console errors or warnings.

8. **Documentation:**

   - Add a `README.md` file with clear instructions on how to install, run, and use the project.

9. **Submission:**

   - Push your code to your GitHub repository.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

- Correct implementation of React components and hooks.
- Proper use of Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Project structure and code organization.
- Clear and concise documentation.
- Successful testing of the components.
